# 3.8 Product Backlog

## Overview

This document contains the prioritized product backlog for the Voice AI system. The backlog items are derived from user stories, use cases, and technical requirements. Items are prioritized based on business value, technical dependencies, and implementation complexity.

## Backlog Prioritization

The backlog uses the following priority levels:

- **Critical**: Must be implemented for minimum viable product
- **High**: Important for core functionality, should be implemented early
- **Medium**: Valuable features that enhance the system
- **Low**: Nice-to-have features that can be implemented later

## Estimation Approach

Story points are used for estimating effort using the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21). The estimates reflect relative effort considering:

- Technical complexity
- Uncertainty
- Amount of work
- Risk

## Backlog organization 

The system is organized into several key functional areas:

- Technical Infrastructure (WebRTC, speech services, RAG implementation)
- Frontend Development (UI components for conversation)
- Core Conversation Capabilities (Spanish language processing, intent recognition)
- Information Retrieval (knowledge base)
- Document Assistance
- System Administration

Other functional areas for testing purpose only:

- Human Agent Integration
- Appointment Management

## Backlog Refinement

The product backlog is refined regularly according to the following schedule:

- **Weekly**: Product Owner reviews and updates priorities
- **Bi-weekly**: Backlog refinement meeting with development team
- **Pre-Sprint**: Final refinement before sprint planning

## Backlog Grooming Criteria

New backlog items are evaluated against the following criteria:

1. **Alignment**: Does the item align with product vision and goals?
2. **Value**: Does the item provide clear value to users or the business?
3. **Clarity**: Is the item clearly defined and understood?
4. **Testability**: Can we define clear acceptance criteria?
5. **Size**: Is the item appropriately sized or does it need to be broken down?

## Definition of Ready

A backlog item is considered "Ready" for sprint planning when:

1. It has a clear description
2. It has defined acceptance criteria
3. It has been estimated by the development team
4. Dependencies are identified
5. It is understood by the team
