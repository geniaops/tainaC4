# 3.8 Product Backlog - TAINA

## Overview

This document contains the prioritized product backlog for the TAINA Voice AI system. The backlog items are derived from the client's requirements document "IA para la Ciudadanía", user stories, use cases, and technical requirements. Items are prioritized based on business value, technical dependencies, and implementation complexity.

## Backlog Prioritization

The backlog uses the following priority levels:

- **Critical**: Must be implemented for minimum viable product
- **High**: Important for core functionality, should be implemented early
- **Medium**: Valuable features that enhance the system
- **Low**: Nice-to-have features that can be implemented later

## Estimation Approach

Story points are used for estimating effort using the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21). The estimates reflect relative effort considering:

- Technical complexity
- Uncertainty
- Amount of work
- Risk

## Backlog Organization 

The system is organized into several key functional areas:

- Technical Infrastructure (WebRTC, speech services, RAG implementation)
- Frontend Development (UI components for conversation)
- Core Conversation Capabilities (Spanish language processing, intent recognition)
- Information Retrieval (knowledge base)
- Government Service Integration
- Data Collection and Analysis
- Deployment Options
- System Administration
